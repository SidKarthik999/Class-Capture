# Class-Capture

To use Class Capture hou must download flask and then using terminal cd into the Class Capture repository. Now run the command 'flask run'.

The app will now be deployed at 127.0.0.1:5000.

When you click the download button it will download ClassCapture_Master.zip to your computer. Once you unzip this file this is where the
facial recognition takes place.

You have to open up the ClassCapture_Master file in a code editor, we used VSC, and then you don't have to touch any of the files all you have to do
is run the program ClassCapture or the program security. If you run ClassCapture the default attendance program will run through your camera. 
If you run the security program then the program will print out INTRUDER ALERT! whenever it detects someone not part of it's face databse.

You can also add faces to the face database if you want to. To do this just drag and drop images into the faces folder and as long as it's the right file
type the code will continue to run but with the new faces you have added.
